# CSSE230, Exam Review Session 2

This GitHub contains a couple of coding problems to help prepare you for Exam 2.

There are two of what I'd consider some easier problems (as in, not a ton going on with them) and one more strenuous problem.

Note that the test cases are not exhaustive, so I'd highly encourage you to add onto them if you feel you are missing an edge case that can be exposed easily by a test case.
